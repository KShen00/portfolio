  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I enjoy the great outdoors, fitness, and soft furry creates, namely cats!</p>
    
  <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I hold an MBA with an emphasis in leadership and management, a BA in public policy, and I'm near completion of a certificate in human resources management. I do administrative work in HR with experience in recruitments and employee benefits. While my work experience is comfortable, I'm ready for new challenges in a new field where I can utilize my skills in attention to detail and creativity.</p>
    
  <h3>Hobbies and Skills</h3>
    <p>I enjoy nature and like to spend time outdoors, whether it's outdoor fitness, going to the beach or watching the sunset. Sometimes I get a spark of creativity when I'm outside and I like to capture nature in all of its beauty by taking photos. I grew up enjoying photogaphy, and still do, but haven't made the time to explore it further in recent year from being to busy.
