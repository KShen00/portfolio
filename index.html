  <h3 class="center">About Me</h3>
  <p>I enjoy the great outdoors, fitness, and soft furry creates, namely <strong>cats!</strong></p>
    
  <h3 class="center">Background</h3>
  <p>I hold an MBA with an emphasis in leadership and management, a BA in public policy, and I'm near completion of a certificate in human resources management. I do administrative work in HR with experience in recruitments and employee benefits. While my work experience is comfortable, <span class="newness">I'm ready for new challenges in a new field where I can utilize my skills in attention to detail and creativity.</span></p>
    
  <h3 class="center">Hobbies and Skills</h3>
  <p>I enjoy nature and like to spend time outdoors, whether it's outdoor fitness, going to the beach or watching the sunset. Sometimes I get a spark of creativity when I'm outside and I like to capture nature in all of its beauty by taking photos. I grew up enjoying photogaphy, and still do, but haven't made the time to explore it further in recent year from being too busy. However, since enrolling in Epicodus and learning to create my own webpage, I'm inspired to create my own webpage containing some of my favorite images I've captured. It would be like a digital journal containing:</p>
  <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>Photos of nature</li>
     <li>Vibrant colors</li>
      <li>A description of what I observed in the moment</li>
    </ol>
